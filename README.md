# ANE-LAB for MAC & WIN

This software is available to MyFlashLabs' Club Members ONLY. It takes care of ANE implementation in your AIR projects. You no longer have to spend hours reading setup instructions for different ANEs. This software will automatically read the ANE and configures your manifest .xml file on the fly. It also copies any necessary resources that ANEs might have. It will copy probable *.framework files to the AIR SDK too. It also checks the necessary dependencies and copies them on the fly. In simple terms, you will use this software to see the available ANEs and with just a simple click, the ANE will be installed in your AIR project. Even when there is a update for that ANE, you will be notified and again with a simple click, the ANE will be updated.
